                <h3>About This Portfolio</h3>
                <p>This portfolio aims to supplement my resume by presenting some selected projects I have developed throughout my undergraduate studies. I believe that one of the most important parts of an undergraduate degree is to participate in hands-on projects.</p>
                <p>Throughout the last 3 years as a Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering student, I was involved with a diverse selection of projects. This portfolio highlights four projects that helped enrich my technical knowledge, refine my collaboration and teamwork skills, and bring out my passion for my degree.</p>
                <p>For each project, I provide an overview, important descriptions, photos, and contributions. If you have any questions about a specific project, feel free to get in touch with me by e-mail or on LinkedIn.</p>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>This project was developed for the Western Engineering Competition (WEC) in the Re-Engineering category. Our team was given a problem statement to convert a terrestrial RC vehicle into a functional underwater ROV. We successfully completed our design, report, and presentation within an allotted 6-hour time frame, earning us <strong>1st Place</strong> in our category and qualifying to represent Western University at the provincial level during the Ontario Engineering Competition (OEC).</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Re-Engineered Design Considerations:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designed an aluminum support frame (Figure A) with protective guards and pool-noodle bumpers to provide high structural rigidity and impact resistance for internal electronics. Materials selected are cost-efficient, environmentally safe, and widely available.</li>
                    <li>Engineered thrusters (Figure B) with waterproof motor housings featuring front-facing intake ducts and O-ring seals to improve laminar flow and maximize propulsion efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Developed a piston-style ballast tank (Figure C), driven by a linear actuator to control displacement, allowing the ROV to achieve precise buoyancy (through a ROV mass calculation) and vertical depth control.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>As provincial finalists at the Ontario Engineering Competition, our team was tasked with re-engineering critical components of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We focused our modifications on the Spacecraft Bus (as illustrated in Figures F and G) across two separate challenges:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Case 1 (Structural & Systems):</strong> A week-long intensive research and design project focused on increasing the spacecraft's operational lifespan.</li>
                    <li><strong>Case 2 (Communications):</strong> A 6-hour project to re-engineer signal transmission architecture for deep-space suitability.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            </div>

            <div class="project-details">
                <h3>Case 1 Modifications</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Material Optimization:</strong> Replaced Aluminum Honeycomb panels with High-Modulus E-CFRP (Epoxy Adhesive Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer) to reduce overall spacecraft mass.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hybrid Thruster System:</strong> Replaced 8 of 12 chemical thrusters with MaSMi Hall Effect thrusters, vastly improving the JWST fuel efficiency and operational lifespan. This is shown at the base of Figures F and G.</li>
                    <li><strong>Power Integration:</strong> Swapped traditional solar arrays for a small-scale fission reactor system to provide a power source suitable for deep-space.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Case 1 Methods</h4>
                <p>Created a modified optimization equation (Figures H and I) that helped us understand the relationship between dry mass, propellant mass, thruster specific impulse, and longevity of telescope. This formula aided us in selecting components with appropriate specifications for our goals.</p>
                <p>For thrusters and power generation, mass and specific impulse were considered. Inspiration for power generation was drawn from NASA's Kilopower Reactor using Stirling Technology (KRUSTY). Ashby charts were utilized for materials selection.</p>
                <p>Alongside an extensive decision process and failure mode analysis (Figure J), our iterations were capable of extending the JWST's lifespan by <strong>300%</strong>.</p>

                <h3>Case 2 Modifications and Methods</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Laser Transmission Network:</strong> Developed an intermediate satellite constellation utilizing laser communication after the first intermediate satellite instead of traditional radio waves. This increases transmission rates and weakens attenuation over long distances.</li>
                    <li><strong>Redundant Pathing & Risk Mitigation:</strong> Designed a multipath transmission relay system to mitigate signal interference from celestial bodies and other interferences, ensuring continuous communication between Earth and Pluto.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rapid Concept Development:</strong> Executed entire system architecture, decision processes, budget considerations, risk mitigation strategies, and a finalized report and presentation within a 6-hour competition timeframe.</li>
                    <li><strong>Targeted Subsystem Optimization:</strong> Each intermediate satellite (D, E, and F) is optimized based on its distance from the sun (Figure M). For example, satellite F has smaller solar panels, a smaller propellant tank, and a larger power generator than satellite D to compensate for decreased solar flux and maintain power requirements for thrusters in low-light environments.</li>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>As a member of Engineers Without Borders (Western Chapter), I am part of a multi-disciplinary team designing and building a sustainable Aquaponic Farm. Since September 2024, we have progressed through several design iterations of our project, and are constantly modifying and improving its design. This project is currently in the active fabrication phase, moving from digital twin concepts to a physical, working system.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-details">
                <h3>Proposal & Early Stages</h3>
                <p>Guided by the core mission of Engineers Without Borders, this project focuses on food security and sustainable infrastructure. Our primary goal was to design an accessible, low-cost aquaponic system that could be constructed using standard workshop tools and readily available materials like PVC and pine. This project serves as a practical opportunity to mentor engineers in hands-on fabrication, moving from conceptual ideation sketches (Figures S and T) to a scalable and structural design.</p>

                <h3>Current & Future Steps</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fish Enrichment & Structural Design:</strong> Designed and fabricated a custom "fish tunnel" to improve the tank's internal architecture. This component was first modeled in SolidWorks (Figure X) and then integrated into the physical tank (Figure Y). Our structural design, first modeled on SolidWorks (Figures U and V), is shown constructed in Figure W.</li>
                    <li><strong>Future Iterations:</strong> Developing a real-time monitoring system using LabVIEW to track pH levels, water temperature, and nitrate concentrations. Creating long-term plans for fish, plant, and tank maintenance.</li>
                </ul>
