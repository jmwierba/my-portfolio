                <h3>About This Portfolio</h3>
                <p>This portfolio aims to supplement my resume by presenting some selected projects I have developed throughout my undergraduate studies. I believe that one of the most important parts of an undergraduate degree is to participate in hands-on projects.</p>
                <p>Throughout the last 3 years as a Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering student, I was involved with a diverse selection of projects. This portfolio highlights four projects that helped enrich my technical knowledge, refine my collaboration and teamwork skills, and bring out my passion for my degree.</p>
                <p>For each project, I provide an overview, important descriptions, photos, and contributions. If you have any questions about a specific project, feel free to get in touch with me by e-mail or on LinkedIn.</p>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>This project was developed for the Western Engineering Competition (WEC) in the Re-Engineering category. Our team was given a problem statement to convert a terrestrial RC vehicle into a functional underwater ROV. We successfully completed our design, report, and presentation within an allotted 6-hour time frame, earning us <strong>1st Place</strong> in our category and qualifying to represent Western University at the provincial level during the Ontario Engineering Competition (OEC).</p>

                <h3>Re-Engineered Design Considerations:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Aluminum Support Frame:</strong> Designed with protective guards and pool-noodle bumpers to provide high structural rigidity and impact resistance for internal electronics. Materials selected are cost-efficient, environmentally safe, and widely available.</li>
                    <li><strong>Engineered Thrusters:</strong> Waterproof motor housings featuring front-facing intake ducts and O-ring seals to improve laminar flow and maximize propulsion efficiency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Piston-Style Ballast Tank:</strong> Driven by a linear actuator to control displacement, allowing the ROV to achieve precise buoyancy and vertical depth control.</li>

            <div class="project-overview">
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>As provincial finalists at the Ontario Engineering Competition, our team was tasked with re-engineering critical components of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We focused our modifications on the Spacecraft Bus across two separate challenges:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Case 1 (Structural & Systems):</strong> A week-long intensive research and design project focused on increasing the spacecraft's operational lifespan.</li>
                    <li><strong>Case 2 (Communications):</strong> A 6-hour project to re-engineer signal transmission architecture for deep-space suitability.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="project-details">
                <h3>Case 1 Modifications</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Material Optimization:</strong> Replaced Aluminum Honeycomb panels with High-Modulus E-CFRP (Epoxy Adhesive Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer) to reduce overall spacecraft mass.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hybrid Thruster System:</strong> Replaced 8 of 12 chemical thrusters with MaSMi Hall Effect thrusters, vastly improving fuel efficiency and operational lifespan.</li>
                    <li><strong>Power Integration:</strong> Swapped traditional solar arrays for a small-scale fission reactor system to provide a power source suitable for deep-space.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Methods & Analysis</h4>
                <p>Created a modified optimization equation to understand the relationship between dry mass, propellant mass, thruster specific impulse, and longevity of telescope. This formula aided in selecting components with appropriate specifications.</p>
                <p>Utilized Ashby charts for materials selection and conducted extensive degradation mechanism analysis. Our iterations were capable of extending the JWST's lifespan by <strong>300%</strong>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project-details">
                <h3>Case 2 Modifications</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Laser Transmission Network:</strong> Developed an intermediate satellite constellation utilizing laser communication to increase transmission rates and weaken attenuation over long distances.</li>
                    <li><strong>Redundant Pathing & Risk Mitigation:</strong> Designed a multipath transmission relay system to mitigate signal interference from celestial bodies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Targeted Subsystem Optimization:</strong> Each intermediate satellite optimized based on its distance from the sun to maintain power requirements in varying solar flux environments.</li>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>In collaboration with Maglin Site Furniture, our group engineered a sustainable solution for the 'Iconic Bench' following the endangerment of their primary material, Ipe wood. Through in-depth indexing and manufacturing analysis, we proposed Black Locust as a high-performance, wood-based replacement. Our design ensures long-term outdoor durability while adhering to modern environmental compliance and ethical sourcing standards.</p>

                    <li>Used Ashby Charts to compare Young's Modulus, yield strength, and density across various North American hardwoods and engineered lumbers.</li>
                    <li>Selected Thermally Modified Black Locust due to its high Janka hardness, exceptional decay resistance, and 50-year service life without chemical preservatives.</li>
                    <li>Tested for failure modes such as thermal cycling, distributed loads from heavy snowfall, and bending using SolidWorks FEA Simulations.</li>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>As a member of Engineers Without Borders (Western Chapter), I am part of a multi-disciplinary team designing and building a sustainable Aquaponic Farm. Since September 2024, we have progressed through several design iterations and are currently in the active fabrication phase, moving from digital twin concepts to a physical, working system.</p>

                <h3>Proposal & Goals</h3>
                <p>Guided by the core mission of Engineers Without Borders, this project focuses on food security and sustainable infrastructure. Our primary goal was to design an accessible, low-cost aquaponic system that could be constructed using standard workshop tools and readily available materials like PVC and pine. This project serves as a practical opportunity to mentor engineers in hands-on fabrication.</p>
